# Playground API

[`openapi.yml`](../openapi.yml) is the canonical API specification. It defines request and response schemas, parameters, status codes, and examples. The production API base URL is `https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/api`.

AI agents can do a great job of explaining the specification, generating a client, or producing request examples from `openapi.yml`. Treat the OpenAPI document as the source of truth when this page and the specification differ.

## Endpoints

- `GET /tags` lists the ClickHouse version tags available for query runs.
- `GET /build-types` lists supported build types. `release` uses a Docker Hub image; non-release types require local builds to be enabled.
- `POST /images/prepare` starts, or checks, preparation of a non-release image for a version and build type.
- `GET /images/status` returns the preparation state for a version and build type: `building`, `ready`, or `failed`.
- `POST /runs` executes a SQL query and returns its output and a query-run ID.
- `GET /runs/{id}` retrieves the details and output of a previously completed query run.

## Flows

For a release query, call `GET /tags`, select a version, then send the SQL and version to `POST /runs`. Use the returned `query_run_id` with `GET /runs/{id}` when you need to retrieve the stored run.

For a debug or sanitizer query, call `GET /tags` and `GET /build-types`, then call `POST /images/prepare`. Poll `GET /images/status` until the image is `ready`; only then submit `POST /runs` with the same version and build type. A `409` response from `/runs` means the image is not ready yet.
